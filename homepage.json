The cold-blooded kid hates Koko’s line of work, but following her into the darkest corners of the black market might be the only way he can find those responsible for his family’s slaughter. Besides, his employer isn’t like most merchants of death. She uses guile and cutthroat tactics to keep her clients armed to the teeth—all while cultivating her own warped plan for the future of world peace. With the CIA desperate for her capture, assassins eager to collect her head, and the potential for every contract to end in ultra-violence, Koko and her comrades in arms bring the boom to every corner of the world.",

It focuses on the character of Tarzan in his early years, after his first exposure to civilization, but before his marriage to Jane. The series uses much of the mythology of Edgar Rice Burroughs' books as background material.\n\nThis version of Tarzan was filmed in the Sun City resort in South Africa, making it one of the few Tarzan productions to actually film on that continent.\n\nThe character of Nicholas Rokoff, and the fact that Tarzan is not yet married, set this series in-between the two halves of The Return of Tarzan.\n\nR. A. Salvatore wrote an authorized Tarzan novel based on pilot script which was published as a trade-paperback in 1996, and a mass-market paperback in 1997.",
